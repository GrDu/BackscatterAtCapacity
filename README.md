 The numbers in the filenames relate to the figure number in the paper. For example, eval03_*.m is the script that generates Figure 3.

Apart from backscatter load modulation, the repository contains some useful information-theoretic functions concerning real- or complex-valued (i.e. quadrature) additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. In particular:
- Computing the achievable information rate with a finite symbol alphabet over a real- or complex-valued AWGN channel.
- Computing the achievable information rate with discrete-amplitude-and-uniform-independent-phase (DAUIP) transmit signaling over a complex-valued AWGN channel.
- Computing the channel capacity of a peak-power-limited real- or complex-valued AWGN channel.
